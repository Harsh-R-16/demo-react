useEffect is used to perform side effects in react projects.

outside components we can perform the side effects with useEffect hook.

by default useEffect runs after every rerender.

we can add dependency and cleanup function.
we can not place any react hook in conditionals statements
we can write conditionals statements in side hooks.

dependency list we can add so we decide whether useEffect should run or not.

short circuit evaluation of useEffect

a || b
a && b  this are short circuit evaluation.

we can not use for loop or while or if else in jsx code
because it does not return any thing that's why 

short circuit evaluation or ternary evaluation return something that we use in jsx code.
